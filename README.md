Why do we call it a "piece of art"? What makes it a "piece", as though it is some one-eighth slice of a whole or a removeable-attachable appendage. This may be a linguistic question rather than a conceptual one, but the thought still stands. What makes an individual something "art" or "not art"? I think it might actually have to do with its piece-ness. A piece has bounds, outer edges that keep it from bleeding into everything else around it. A piece is a piece because it isn't some other piece, but its own entity. 

With "Jitterbug", I was originally inspired by motion. The "tickle" motion demoed on the p5.js website caught my eye, and I started playing around with it. The first element I added was a set of outer bounds, so the object would be contained. This led to the idea of "trapped-ness" and running. The jitter motion reminded me of panic, of sudden reveal. For the first iteration of this sketch, I expressed that idea through Pacman. It reminded me of chasing and running, and the jitter motion reminded me of the ghosts. A nod to a retro game as a method to express the emotions I was trying to capture. 

On a conceptual level, my goal with this piece is to bring the audience into a relatable emotional experience, one that we all have. On the optimistic side of the spectrum, you could call it discovery. On the opposite side, panic. Light-dark contrast is my vehicle for communicating the sudden shift in conditions, and motion the causal effect mirroring our internal state when we receive a shock that sends us topsy-turvy. 

Jeff Koons says that art is about acceptance - his chosen vehicle is aluminum balloon animals. Wolfgang Leib focuses on the essence of experience - he has devoted his life to collecting and creating with pollen. I believe both of these things. Only my medium here is neither aluminum animals nor pollen. Casey Reas creates art pieces with geometric interaction and evolving shapes. This more closely mirrors where I want to take my sketch - to emulate and evoke emotion with concept and shape.
